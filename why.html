        <p>Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.<br><br>

        Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that take hundreds of millions of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.<br><br>
        
        Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from fossil fuels, which currently account for the lions share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing the climate crisis.<br><br>
        
        Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.</p>
